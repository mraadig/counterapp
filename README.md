# Counter App

This is a simple React web application that allows you to increment and decrement a counter with buttons. The app features a progress bar that visually represents the counter value, and it supports undo/redo functionality for the counter operations. The counter value cannot exceed 150 or go below 0. Additionally, holding down the increment or decrement button will rapidly change the counter value.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Two buttons to increase or decrease the counter value.
- **Progress Bar**: A visual representation of the counter value, with a smooth transition effect.
- **Undo/Redo**: Ability to undo and redo the last changes made to the counter value.
- **Rapid Increment/Decrement**: Holding down the buttons allows for rapid changes in the counter value.
- **State Constraints**: The counter value is constrained to be within the range of 0 to 150.
